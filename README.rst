Bluff is a rules-based data generator.

See ``dataset.blf`` for designing relationships and seed data sets. Bluff is currently limited to taking a predefined dataset and generating sibling datasets based on a relationship and rules defined by that relationship.

The "requested_at" field in ``dataset.blf`` is an initial design of a rule based dataset and is non-functioning.

TODO:
=====

- Add tests
- Add support for rule based datasets
- Add performance benchmarks
